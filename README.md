# ðŸ—º Risk Board Game

## How to Run

We use **Scala** + **Play Framework** for backend, **React** for frontend, and **WebSocket** to communicate between them.

Besides having JDK 8 and SBT installed, make sure to install the **latest** version of Node.js and NPM. (i.e., errors regarding `react-scripts` are mostly due to an old version of NPM.)

After `sbt run`, it will automatically open `http://localhost:3000` in browser.

## How to Contribute (Git Test)

This [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/CoolProp/CoolProp/wiki/Contributing%3A-git-development-workflow) of another open source project well describe how to use Git for collaborative development. We are going to follow their guidelines except for that we don't have `release` branch yet.
